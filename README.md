## Nothing Personal

I have dear friends and family who clearly benefit greatly from CrossFit. This is just my way of extracting some
entertainment from their Facebook & Twitter reports of jerks, hang cleans, hang power snatches and "ball slams".

## Please Don't Hurt Me, CrossFit

It should go without saying that this has not been approved by the good people of CrossFit
(a subsidiary of Haliburton, that's a joke). If a lawyer from CrossFit/Haliburton contacts me, all muscles flexed,
lifting his/her terrified children/grandparents over their head then I'll take this down immediately.
